        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
        subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia.
        Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may
        be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
        adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
        called a pullet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
        were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
        BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[3] up from more than
        19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than any
        other bird.[4] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in
        myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

      <p>
        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas,
        Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
        Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been known
        in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
        every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar,
        Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]

      <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Chickens are omnivores.[25] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil
        to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small
        snakes,[26] or young mice.[27]
      </p>
      <p>
        The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed.[28]
        The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure
        at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[29]
      </p>
      <p>
        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking
        plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks
        ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter,
        bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some
        breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
        pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification
        can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development
        of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the
        male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens
        have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and
        hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles.
        Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and
        throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles
        and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A
        'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which
        causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance
        of a beard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
        lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances,
        such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).
        Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but
        generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
      </p>
      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
      <p>
        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
        communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
        Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
        "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food
        access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
        causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking
        order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
        existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[30]
      </p>
      <p>
        When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He
        does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
        the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call
        their chicks and encourage them to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a
        territorial signal to other roosters.[31] However, roosters may also
        crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens
        cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks.
        Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator
        approaching from the air or on the ground.[32]
      </p>
      <h4>Courtship</h4>
      <p>
        To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near
        a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering the wing which is closest to
        the hen.[35] The dance triggers a response in the hen[35] and when she
        responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with
        the mating.
      </p>
      <p>
        More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:
